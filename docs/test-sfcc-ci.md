**[â†¤ Getting Started](../README.md)**

Test SFCC-CI
===

> We should be ready to test out that we have SFCC-CI installed correctly.

Let's up a new terminal window and run the following commands:

```bash
# Login with API Client Data we just entered
sfcc-ci client:auth
```

This command should output:

```text
Authentication succeeded
```

If it didn't, head back through the first few steps and make sure you setup everything correctly.
