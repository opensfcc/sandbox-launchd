Test SFCC-CI
===

> We should be ready to test that we have SFCC-CI installed correctly.

Let's check that our API Client Authentication information was entered correctly:

```bash
sfcc-ci client:auth
```

If you did not get a response of `Authentication succeeded`, head back through the first few steps and ensure you set up everything correctly.
